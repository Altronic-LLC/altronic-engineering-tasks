# Backlog

Queued work for upcoming releases. Items at the top are highest-priority /
next-up. When picking something up, move it to a release in `CHANGELOG.ts`
(via the changelog protocol in `CLAUDE.md`) and delete it from this list.

This is intentionally informal — a running list of "things we want, in
roughly the order we want them." No tickets, no story points. If an item
needs detail, add a sub-bullet underneath it.

---

## Next up

- **Catch-up notification on app open.** When a user lands on the app
  after being away, surface a short "while you were gone" summary —
  new tasks assigned to them, new comments on items they're watching,
  EIRs that changed status, and anything @-mentioning them. Driven by
  the user's last-seen timestamp (stored per-user, probably in
  `localStorage` keyed by email + bumped on every full app load) and
  the `lastModifiedDateTime` already on every Task / EIR / comment.
  Render as a dismissible banner under the header on the Dashboard
  with deep links into the affected items. Avoid emails for this —
  this is the "I came back to the app" recap, not a push.

- **PWA installable.** Wire the app so users can install it from the
  browser (Edge "Apps" / Chrome "Install" / mobile "Add to Home
  Screen"). Concrete steps: add `public/manifest.webmanifest` with
  name, short_name, theme + background colour (Cooper Red on white),
  icons (192/512 PNG + maskable), `display: "standalone"`,
  `start_url: "/altronic-engineering-tasks/"`,
  `scope: "/altronic-engineering-tasks/"`. Link from `index.html`,
  add `<meta name="theme-color">`. Register a minimal service worker
  (consider `vite-plugin-pwa` — handles manifest + SW + auto-update
  pattern cleanly) with a network-first strategy for Graph calls and
  cache-first for the built assets. Verify Lighthouse PWA score and
  the install prompt appears in Edge on a fresh visit. Don't bother
  with offline mode for SharePoint data yet — installable + chrome-
  less window is the goal, offline-first is a separate, much bigger
  effort.

## Later

(empty)

## Done / shipped

When an item ships, move it into the corresponding CHANGELOG entry in
`src/data/changelog.ts` and delete it from this file. Don't keep a
"shipped" section here — the changelog is the record of what's done.

## Followups from the v0.2.0 batch

These are not formal backlog items, but flagging in case you want to track
them after a real-mode shakedown:

- **Comment race condition.** The `Communication` field is a single text
  blob that we read, prepend to, and write back. Two users commenting on
  the same task within ~500ms of each other can produce a lost-update
  where one comment overwrites the other. Same issue affects the Power
  App (same field, same write pattern), so this is not a regression. The
  "show me if someone else commented" feature in the Next-up section
  addresses this by making the conflict visible. A more durable fix
  would be either etag-based optimistic concurrency or moving comments
  to a separate SharePoint list — both bigger lifts.
- **Verify the parent-task field's actual internal name** in SharePoint.
  The mapper assumes `ParentTaskLookupId`; if the column is named
  something else (e.g. `Parent_x0020_Task_x0020_ReferLookupId`), update
  `src/lib/taskMapper.ts` and the GraphItemFields typedef.
- **Verify the multi-value related-projects field's internal name** —
  currently assumed to be `ProjectReference`. If it's not, same edits as
  above plus `ProjectReference` references throughout.
- **Verify the Software Revision field's internal name** in SharePoint.
  Currently assumed to be `SoftwareRevision`. Power App labels it
  "Software Revision" but the column's internal name may differ.
- **Verify the projects-list ID** and set `VITE_SP_PROJECTS_LIST_ID`. Run
  the lookup-discovery PowerShell snippet from CLAUDE.md once the parent
  app registration is in place.
- **Upload attachments to a SharePoint document library** in real mode.
  Today attachments are in-memory only (mock mode behavior). When the
  storage rules are decided, add the upload step inside `addComment` in
  `src/api/tasks.ts` — the `attachments` argument is already plumbed
  through; just needs the upload-to-SharePoint code.
- **Replace hardcoded admin allow-list** with SharePoint group
  membership. See `src/hooks/useIsAdmin.ts` for the current approach
  and TODO comment.
