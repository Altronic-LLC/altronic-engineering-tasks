          Every change you make — status, priority, due date, parent project,
          assignees, watchers, etc. — surfaces a confirmation toast at the
          bottom-right of the screen. Most carry an <strong>Undo</strong>{" "}
          button.
        </P>
        <P>
          Click Undo within ~7 seconds of an accidental change and the previous
          value is restored both in the UI and on SharePoint. After that the
          toast dismisses and the change is locked in.
        </P>
        <P>
          If a write fails, a red toast tells you what went wrong and the
          change automatically rolls back — you don't have to do anything.
        </P>
        <P>
          The mutations that <em>don't</em> have Undo: comment add (SharePoint
          doesn't expose delete-a-comment), task create (we'd have to delete
          the newly-created task and renumber), and project create. You'll see
          a confirmation but no Undo button.
