// =============================================================================
// Application changelog.
//
// HOW TO UPDATE: When making a meaningful user-visible change, add a new
// entry to the TOP of this array (newest first). Bump the version using
// semver-lite rules:
//   - MAJOR (1.x.x → 2.0.0): big rework, breaking changes to data model
//   - MINOR (0.1.x → 0.2.0): new feature (Kanban view, comment editor, etc.)
//   - PATCH (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): bug fix, copy change, small UI polish
//
// Keep entries succinct — one line each, written from the user's POV.
// Group related changes under one version.

      "@-mention emails redesigned: Cooper Red branded header with the ALTRONIC wordmark, the task title called out in its own block, the comment quoted in a card, and a proper red 'Open this task' button instead of a plain text link",
      "Body line now reads 'You were mentioned in a task by X' (was 'in a comment') so it scans cleanly at a glance",

      "Emails go out from a shared mailbox (configurable via the new VITE_SHARED_MAILBOX repo variable) using the signed-in user's Send-As permission — so recipients see a consistent 'from' address. Requires the new Mail.Send.Shared Graph scope (one-time admin consent). See CLAUDE.md for the setup steps",

The Graph round-trip happens in the background; if it fails, the cache rolls back to the previous state",
