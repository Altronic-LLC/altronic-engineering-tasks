// =============================================================================
// Application changelog.
//
// HOW TO UPDATE: When making a meaningful user-visible change, add a new
// entry to the TOP of this array (newest first). Bump the version using
// semver-lite rules:
//   - MAJOR (1.x.x → 2.0.0): big rework, breaking changes to data model
//   - MINOR (0.1.x → 0.2.0): new feature (Kanban view, comment editor, etc.)
//   - PATCH (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): bug fix, copy change, small UI polish
//
// Keep entries succinct — one line each, written from the user's POV.
// Group related changes under one version.
